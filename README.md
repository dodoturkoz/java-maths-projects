Both of these projects were made for the module MA117 - Programming for Scientists given at the University of Warwick.

## Fractal Generator
In this project, we use the secant method and use colors to distinguish between convergence to different roots. Although it is not suprising that this produces fractals which look rather appealing due to self-similarity. Here is an example fractal which was produced by running this program.

Ever wondered about the statistical properties of matrices? In this project, we explore the variance of random nxn matrices and tridiagonal matrices.
