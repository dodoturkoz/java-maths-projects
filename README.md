Both of these projects were made for the module MA117 - Programming for Scientists given at the University of Warwick.

## Fractal Generator
In this project, we use the secant method to approximate the roots of polynomials in complex coefficients and use colors to distinguish between convergence to different roots. This produces fractals which look rather appealing due to self-similarity. Here is an example fractal which was produced by running this program.

## Matrix Statistics

In this project, we explore the variance of random nxn matrices and tridiagonal matrices using abstract classes.
